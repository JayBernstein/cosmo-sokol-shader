# cosmo-sokol

Sample sokol+dearimgui application compiled with cosmopolitan toolchain.

## Build instruction

With cosmocc in your PATH, run `./build`.

Then run `./main`.

Note: On Windows, if you are using a NVIDIA graphic card, you may have to disable "Threaded optimization".

## How it works

TL;DR: dlopen and codegen for Xlib and GL.

TODO: Elaborate.
